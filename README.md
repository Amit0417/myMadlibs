# myMadlibs
I just create a Madlib game , for those who did'nt know about it.
Madlib is a word filling game in which you can create some funny stories.
Madlib is fun game where you can make mad stories by filling some random words by your own choice.
You just have to run the mYmaDlib.py file.
And when the code execute it will ask some words to fill
just fill those words and YAY!.
Here is your Madlib....
